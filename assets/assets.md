# Assets Folder

The `assets` folder is used to store static assets such as images, fonts, or icons in your Next.js project. Static assets are files that are not processed by Next.js at build time and can be directly served to the client.

## Usage

You can place your assets in the `assets` folder and reference them within your Next.js components or pages. Here are some common use cases:

- **Images**: Store image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) that are used within your application. You can use the assets folder to organize images for headers, logos, illustrations, or any other visual content.

- **Fonts**: Store font files (e.g., `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) that are used for custom typography in your application. You can include font files and use them with CSS or a font-loading library.

- **Icons**: Store icon files (e.g., `.svg`, `.png`) that are used for icons or small graphical elements in your application. You can organize your icon sets within the assets folder.

- **CSS Files**: Store any CSS files (e.g., `.css`, `.scss`) that are not specific to a particular component or page but are used globally throughout your application. These can include custom stylesheets or third-party CSS libraries.

## Best Practices

- Keep the assets folder organized and maintain a clear structure for different asset types (e.g., subfolders for images, fonts, icons).
- Consider optimizing images to reduce file size without compromising quality. Tools like [Next.js Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) can be used to automatically optimize images during the build process.
- Use appropriate naming conventions for assets to ensure clarity and ease of reference within your codebase.

By utilizing the `assets` folder, you can conveniently manage and access static assets within your Next.js project, enhancing the overall development experience.
